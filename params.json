  "body": "# Modular Android-based Intelligent Personal Assistant\r\n\r\n(Abstract) In the time of rapidly increasing pace of digital lifestyle, users increasingly rely on useful and timely information\r\nprovided by the Intelligent Personal Assistants (IPA). As users get more accustomed to using IPA solutions on a daily\r\nbasis, their expectations grow and the requests become more complex. Nonetheless, the development of full-stack\r\nIPA solution for multiple use cases remains complex, due to excessive effort it still requires.\r\n\r\nThe state of the art IPA solutions (e.g., Siri and Google Now) do have the capacity to comprehend users’ behavior\r\nby tracking them through multiple devices and analyzing their personal data. Due to commercial nature of popular\r\nIPA solutions, they are characterized by little, if any, ﬂexibility to allow the extension of the platform by third-\r\nparties. In contrast to commercial, most of the similar research solutions are open to public access (e.g., Device\r\nAnalyzer and Sirius). However, they are often designed for a single use case, which limits their assistance capability\r\nfor additional use cases.\r\n\r\nThis application addresses the issue of multi-app approach by developing a generic Android-based IPA application,\r\nwhich acts as base frame for multiple assistance use cases. The concept is built upon the principle of modular\r\narchitecture, aimed to enable the consolidated utilization of common key functionalities (e.g., tracking, sensor\r\ndata upload or user interfaces), and provide an interface for the new use cases, deﬁned as modules. Developers are\r\nnow able to develop new assistance use cases easily, without the need for client-side modiﬁcations. The evaluation\r\nof the implemented prototype shows that the proposed solution is able to cover multiple use cases in an energy-\r\nefﬁcient and generic way without affecting the user experience.\r\n\r\n### Developers\r\n* [Wladimir Schmidt](https://github.com/wlsc)\r\n\r\n### Dependency\r\n* [Assistance SDK](https://github.com/Telecooperation/assistance-platform-client-sdk-android)\r\n\r\n### License\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n   http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n",
